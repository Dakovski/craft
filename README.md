# Craft Form App

To run the app:

- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`

## Note

This code is written with the specific task in mind. In a more complex / real world scenario, the code should be properly abstracted out with data manipulation and UI presentation neatly divided. This is currently not done for two reasons: time constraint and making sure the code is more quickly understandable with obvious connections between data and UI elements.

## Possible improvements

- Optimize by enabling [React compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler)
- Enhance design in mobile resolutions
- Add unit tests
- Replace built-in HTML checkbox with one from a UI library that looks closer to design
